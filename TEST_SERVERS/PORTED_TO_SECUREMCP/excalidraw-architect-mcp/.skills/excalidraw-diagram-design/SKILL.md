# Excalidraw Diagram Design Guide

This skill teaches you how to structure the `nodes` and `connections` input for the Excalidraw Architect MCP so the auto-layout engine produces clean, readable diagrams - not spaghetti.

## Core Principle

The layout engine (Sugiyama algorithm) works best with **tree-like, flow-oriented graphs**. Your job as the LLM is to model the *data flow story*, not the *import graph*.

## Graph Topology Rules

### 1. Keep it tree-like - avoid diamond dependencies

The #1 cause of messy diagrams is multiple nodes connecting to the same shared target.

```
BAD: 4 arrows all pointing to "models.py"
  mermaid → models
  state   → models
  layout  → models
  builder → models

GOOD: Drop shared infrastructure nodes or show them as a single grouped leaf
  layout → builder → output
```

**Rule**: If a node has 4+ incoming edges, either remove it or group it with related nodes.

### 2. Limit edges to primary data flow

Show how data moves through the system, not every `import` statement.

```
BAD (16 edges for 12 nodes - dependency graph):
  server → mermaid, state, layout, excalidraw
  mermaid → models
  state → models, excalidraw_file
  layout → models, grandalf, components
  excalidraw → models, components, themes, excalidraw_file

GOOD (9 edges for 9 nodes - data flow):
  ide → server → [mermaid, state, layout]
  layout → renderer → [styling, output]
```

**Rule**: Aim for roughly N-1 to N+2 edges for N nodes (tree + a few extra).

### 3. Hub nodes should have 3–5 fan-out, not more

The layout engine auto-stretches "hub" nodes (≥3 connections) into gate-like rectangles. This looks great for API gateways, load balancers, and message brokers. But a node with 6+ fan-out creates too many parallel arrows.

```
GOOD: API Gateway → [Auth, Users, Orders, Payments]  (4 fan-out)
BAD:  Server → [A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H]             (8 fan-out)
```

**Rule**: If a node has 6+ connections, split it into two logical stages or group downstream nodes.

### 4. Keep layers balanced

Each "column" (layer) in a left-right diagram should have 1–4 nodes. If one layer has 6+ nodes, the diagram becomes vertically sprawling.

```
GOOD layer distribution: [1] → [1] → [3] → [2] → [1]
BAD layer distribution:  [1] → [1] → [7] → [1]
```

### 5. Use concise edge labels (≤4 words)

Edge labels affect spacing. Long labels force adaptive gaps to push layers apart. They also increase node height, which makes the obstacle-detection engine more likely to trigger unnecessary detours.

```
GOOD: "LayoutResult", "DiagramGraph", "write JSON"
BAD:  "sends the computed layout result with positioned nodes and edges"
```

**Rule**: Max 4 words per edge label. If you need more context, put it in the node label or drop it.

## Node Design

### Choose the right abstraction level

- **Too granular**: Every function or class as a node → too many nodes
- **Too abstract**: "Frontend" and "Backend" → no useful detail
- **Right level**: One node per module, service, or logical component

### Use component_type for auto-styling

The tool auto-detects technology from labels, but explicit `component_type` is more reliable:

```json
{"id": "cache", "label": "Session Cache", "component_type": "redis"}
{"id": "db", "label": "Order Database", "component_type": "postgresql"}
{"id": "queue", "label": "Event Bus", "component_type": "kafka"}
{"id": "lb", "label": "API Gateway", "component_type": "api_gateway"}
```

### Node count guidelines

| Diagram type | Ideal node count |
|---|---|
| High-level architecture | 6–15 |
| Detailed service flow | 10–25 |
| Service deep-dive (internals, sub-components) | 15–30 |
| Simple sequence | 5–9 |

For diagrams with 20+ nodes, keep labels to **1–2 lines max** - long multi-line labels inflate node sizes and trigger unnecessary obstacle detours. Prefer short, scannable labels (e.g., `DynamoDB: orders` instead of `DynamoDB OrdersTable\n(partition: order_id)`).

## Edge Design

### Direction matters

Default is `LR` (left-to-right). Use this for:
- Architecture diagrams (request flows left to right)
- Data pipelines

Use `TD` (top-down) for:
- Org charts
- Class hierarchies
- Decision trees

### Edge styles

- `solid` (default): Primary data flow
- `dashed`: Optional, async, or metadata paths
- `dotted`: Monitoring, logging, observability
- `thick`: Critical path or high-throughput

## Common Diagram Patterns

### Pattern 1: Gateway Fan-out (architecture)

```
Client → Gateway → [Service A, Service B, Service C]
Each service → Database or Cache (1:1)
```

Produces a clean hub with parallel arrows.

### Pattern 2: Pipeline (data flow)

```
Input → Step 1 → Step 2 → Step 3 → Output
```

Linear chain, optionally with one fork-merge.

### Pattern 3: Pipeline with fork-merge

```
Input → Process → [Branch A, Branch B] → Merge → Output
```

Creates a diamond shape - keep it to ONE fork-merge per diagram.

### Pattern 4: Layered architecture

```
Client → Load Balancer → [Services] → [Databases]
                                     → [Caches]
Monitoring → [Prometheus, Grafana]  (disconnected - auto-stacked)
```

## Anti-Patterns

| Anti-pattern | Problem | Fix |
|---|---|---|
| Every import as an edge | Spaghetti arrows | Show primary data flow only |
| Shared dependency node (4+ incoming) | Arrow crossings, overlaps | Remove or group the node |
| Long edge labels | Excessive spacing, detour triggers | Keep to ≤4 words |
| 30+ nodes without splitting | Unreadable, routing congestion | Split into multiple diagrams |
| Multi-line verbose labels at 20+ nodes | Inflated nodes, false detours | Use 1–2 line labels |
| Multiple fork-merges | Complex crossing patterns | Linearize or split |

## Quick Checklist

Before calling `create_diagram`:

- [ ] ≤15 nodes for architecture, ≤25 for detailed flows, ≤30 for deep-dives
- [ ] Edge count ≈ node count (tree-like, not a mesh)
- [ ] No node has 5+ incoming edges
- [ ] Hub fan-out is 3–5, not 6+
- [ ] Edge labels are ≤4 words each
- [ ] For 20+ nodes: labels are 1–2 lines max
- [ ] Used `component_type` for known technologies
- [ ] One primary flow direction, not a web
