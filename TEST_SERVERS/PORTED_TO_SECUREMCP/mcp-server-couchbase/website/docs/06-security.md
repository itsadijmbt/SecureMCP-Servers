# Security

The Couchbase MCP Server provides multiple layers of security to protect your data when used with LLMs.

## Best Practices Quick Reference

- **Always configure RBAC** - Create a dedicated database user with least-privilege permissions.

- **Keep read-only mode enabled** - `CB_MCP_READ_ONLY_MODE=true` (default) blocks all write operations.

- **Use TLS** - Use `couchbases://` connection strings for encrypted connections.

- **Disable unnecessary tools** - Reduce the attack surface by removing tools you don't need.

- **Enable confirmation for sensitive tools** - Use `CB_MCP_CONFIRMATION_REQUIRED` to prompt users before executing critical operations.

- **Don't rely on a single layer** - Combine RBAC, read-only mode, tool disabling, confirmation, and TLS for defense in depth.

## Read-Only Mode (Default)

By default, `CB_MCP_READ_ONLY_MODE=true`. This:

- **Prevents KV write tools** from being loaded - they won't appear in tool discovery.

- **Blocks SQL++ write queries** - INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE, MERGE, and DDL statements are rejected.

See [Read-Only Mode](./05-configuration/02-read-only-mode.md) for the full configuration reference.

## RBAC Best Practices

:::important
Database RBAC (Role-Based Access Control) permissions are the **authoritative security control**. Always configure appropriate RBAC permissions on your Couchbase user credentials as the primary security measure.
:::

Recommendations:

- **Create a dedicated database user** for the MCP server with only the permissions it needs.

- **Grant read-only roles** if write operations are not needed (e.g., `Data Reader`, `Query Select`).

- **Scope permissions to specific buckets** rather than granting cluster-wide access.

- **Do not rely solely on `CB_MCP_READ_ONLY_MODE` or tool disabling** - these guide LLM behavior but RBAC is the enforcement layer.

See [RBAC for Couchbase Server](https://docs.couchbase.com/server/current/manage/manage-security/manage-users-and-roles.html) or [RBAC for Capella](https://docs.couchbase.com/cloud/clusters/manage-database-users.html) for configuration details.

## Tool Disabling

You can [disable specific tools](./05-configuration/04-disabling-tools.md) to reduce the attack surface.

:::warning
Disabling tools alone does not guarantee operations cannot be performed.

Data modifications can still occur via `run_sql_plus_plus_query` using SQL++ DML statements - unless `CB_MCP_READ_ONLY_MODE=true` or the database user lacks RBAC permissions.
:::

## TLS / mTLS

The server supports:

- **TLS connections** — Use `couchbases://` (with `s`) in your connection string for encrypted connections.

- **Custom CA certificates** — Set `CB_CA_CERT_PATH` for self-signed or untrusted server certificates.

- **mTLS (mutual TLS)** — Set `CB_CLIENT_CERT_PATH` and `CB_CLIENT_KEY_PATH` for certificate-based authentication.

For Capella connections, TLS is always enabled and the bundled Capella root CA is used automatically.

## Elicitation / Confirmation for Tool Calls

You can require user confirmation before specific tools are executed by configuring `CB_MCP_CONFIRMATION_REQUIRED`. When enabled, the server sends an [elicitation](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/docs/concepts/elicitation) request to the client, prompting the user to approve the action before it proceeds.

:::important
Full functionality requires client support for [elicitation](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/clients). If the client does not support it, the tools will be executed without requiring confirmation.
:::

See [Elicitation / Confirmation for Tool Calls](./05-configuration/05-elicitation-for-tools.md) for configuration details.

## Risks Associated with LLMs

- The use of large language models involves risks, including the potential for inaccurate or harmful outputs.

- Couchbase does not review or evaluate the quality or accuracy of LLM outputs, and such outputs may not reflect Couchbase's views.

- You are solely responsible for determining whether to use LLMs and for complying with your organization's policies.

## Summary

For maximum security, layer these controls:

1. **RBAC** - Least-privilege database user permissions (primary control).

2. **Read-Only Mode** - `CB_MCP_READ_ONLY_MODE=true` (default) blocks all write operations.

3. **Tool Disabling** - Remove unnecessary tools from LLM discovery.

4. **Confirmation** - Require user approval before executing sensitive tools.

5. **TLS/mTLS** - Encrypt all network traffic.
