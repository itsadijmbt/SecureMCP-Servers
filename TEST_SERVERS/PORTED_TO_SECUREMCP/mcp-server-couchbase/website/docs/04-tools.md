# Tools

The Couchbase MCP Server exposes several tools across multiple categories. The list of supported tools is constantly evolving so check the [GitHub readme](https://github.com/Couchbase-Ecosystem/mcp-server-couchbase?tab=readme-ov-file#featurestools/) for the latest set of tools. Each tool is available to LLMs through the MCP protocol.

## Cluster Setup & Health

Tools for checking server status and cluster connectivity.

| ---- | ----------- |
| `get_buckets_in_cluster` | Get a list of all the buckets in the cluster |
| `get_scopes_in_bucket` | Get a list of all the scopes in the specified bucket |
| `get_collections_in_scope` | Get a list of all the collections in a specified scope and bucket |
| `get_scopes_and_collections_in_bucket` | Get a list of all the scopes and collections in the specified bucket |
| `get_schema_for_collection` | Infer the document structure for a collection |

## Document KV Operations

Tools for reading and writing documents by ID. Tools that modify data are disabled by default when `CB_MCP_READ_ONLY_MODE=true`.

| Tool | Description |
| ---- | ----------- |
| `get_document_by_id` | Get a document by ID from a specified scope and collection |
| `upsert_document_by_id` | Insert or update a document by ID |
| `insert_document_by_id` | Insert a new document by ID (fails if document exists) |
| `replace_document_by_id` | Replace an existing document by ID (fails if document doesn't exist) |
| `delete_document_by_id` | Delete a document by ID |

## Query and Indexing

Tools for running SQL++ queries, listing indexes, and getting index recommendations.

| Tool | Description |
| ---- | ----------- |
| `run_sql_plus_plus_query` | Run a [SQL++ query](https://www.couchbase.com/sqlplusplus/) on a specified scope |
| `explain_sql_plus_plus_query` | Provides information about the execution plan for the statement. This includes operators such as scans, joins, and filters; it aids in performance tuning by showing index usage, cost estimates, and data access paths |
| `list_indexes` | List all indexes in the cluster with their definitions, with optional filtering |
| `get_index_advisor_recommendations` | Get index recommendations from Couchbase Index Advisor for a given SQL++ query |

## Query Performance Analysis

Tools for identifying slow queries, missing indexes, and optimization opportunities. These tools query `system:completed_requests`.

| ---- | ----------- |
| `get_longest_running_queries` | Get longest running queries by average service time |
| `get_most_frequent_queries` | Get most frequently executed queries |

| `get_queries_not_using_covering_index` | Get queries that do not use a covering index |
| `get_queries_using_primary_index` | Get queries that use a primary index (potential performance concern) |
| `get_queries_with_largest_response_sizes` | Get queries with the largest response sizes |
| `get_queries_with_large_result_count` | Get queries with the largest result counts |
